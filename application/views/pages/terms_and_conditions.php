Please read, understand and accept the below mentioned terms &amp; conditions for your holiday at the time of booking.</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS</p>
<ul class="terms">
<li><span>You/Passenger/Guest/client/customer means the person/s in whose name and/or whose behalf the booking is made and/or whose name appears on the booking form, invoices and includes every person availing the services of Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd.</span></li>
<li><span>We/Us/MHIPL/Mango Holidays refers to Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd.</span></li>
<li><span>Infant means a person below the age of two years. </span></li>
<li><span>Child means a person from the age of two and below the age of twelve years.</span></li>
<li><span>Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. is a Tour Operator. Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. do not own / operate or control Hotels, Railways, Cable Cars, Trams, Airlines, Caterers, Restaurants, Places of sightseeing and entertainment like theme parks, Museums, Art galleries, Shopping Malls, Railway, Ferry, Cruise, Coach, Guides, Insurance Providers, all sightseeing attractions companies etc. who are to provide the services to the Client. The terms and conditions specified by those service providers, including their payment schedule, cancellation, refund etc. shall be applicable, in addition to our terms and conditions mentioned herein. The services comprising the tours are provided by independent entities. Although we select reputed suppliers, Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. or their staff has no direct control over such services or persons providing such services. MHIPL cannot be held responsible if the supplier does not provide the contemplated service or there is a defect or deficiency in the services provided by the supplier. </span></li>
<li><span>This brochure is printed several months in advance and Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information during publication. Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. reserves unconditional rights to change any brochure information before or after the tour is booked due to occurrence of any event beyond our control. </span></li>
<li><span>The maps used in the brochures are inserted solely for illustrations and are not to the scale. Photographs of meals and sightseeing printed in the brochures / website / advertisements are for reference only and may differ from the actual meals served/ sights seen.</span></li>
<li><span>Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. reserves unconditional rights to change/ alter/ amend the final itineraries, tour prices, departure dates, Sightseeing Attractions, Hotels, Restaurants, Coach Companies, Guide Services and any other tour related service or service provider without any prior notice. If we are aware of these changes sufficiently beforehand, we will definitely inform you in advance, otherwise our tour escort or local representative will inform you of the changes on tour. In case the alternative arrangement or services made are materially superior as compared to the one described, we may charge extra for the same. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>We at MHIPL are committed to deliver whatever is promised to you, but due to the circumstances beyond our control &nbsp;like heavy traffic, delayed flights, flight cancellations, missed connections, long lines, less day light, bad weather conditions, border or police checks, coach break down, accidents, VIP movement, riots, strikes, extremist attacks, festivals, earth quake, fire, war, volcanic ash, religious rituals, heavy snow fall, airport closure or any other reason whatsoever, if you miss any sightseeing or if you get less time to cover any museum or any sightseeing then MHIPL is not responsible or liable for the same.</span></li>
<li><span>Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. recommends that, not more than three persons share a room. A triple room is normally of the same size as a double room. In case of triple room, the third bed is usually a roll awaybed or folding cot. </span></li>
<li><span>As the client would be out sightseeing most of the time and retire to the room only for the night, Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. selects hotels at locations, which give comfort and value for money. Hence depending on the day to day itinerary, the hotel may be confirmed either in the city or away from the city centre. Some hotels do not have air conditioners, room heaters or fans. Double rooms in Europe are comparatively small and single rooms are even smaller. A double room has either a single queen-size bed or two separate beds. If the client requests for a room with queen-size bed, the same would be provided subject to availability as majority of the hotels in Europe have twin bedded rooms. In case of non-availability of room with queen-size bed, a twin bedded-room would be given.</span></li>
<li><span>A child for whom “without bed” charge has been paid would not be entitled to a separate bed in the hotel. In case “with bed” ‘charge has been paid for the child and client decides not to avail such facility whilst on the tour, he would not be entitled to any refund. In case client decides to seek extra bed on tour for the child booked on “without bed basis” then subject to availability, he shall be bound to pay additional amount charge to the concerned Hotel directly. </span></li>
<li><span>In case of a request at the time of booking by the client for preference of nearby or inter connecting or adjoining rooms, Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. would take every effort for the same, however as the Hotel management does rooms allocations, hence there is no assurance in this regard. </span></li>
<li><span>The clients / customers will have to abide by the check in and check out times of the Hotels. The guest should themselves manage early arrivals and late departures. (In case of individual travels or in case of direct joining or direct leaving passengers.)</span></li>
<li><span>The average travelling time by coach can be approximately 8 hours a day under normal road conditions. Comfort stops are provided after appropriate intervals having regard to the daily itinerary and therefore, though some of the coaches are equipped with emergency washrooms, such facility can be used only in case of an emergency.</span></li>
<li><span>Smoking, consumption of alcoholic beverages, ice creams, chewing gum and snacks is strictly prohibited on coaches.</span></li>
<li><span>The clients should not leave behind any personal item / property in the coach / car, while disembarking the coach. Mango Holidays (India) Pvt. Ltd. will not be responsible or liable in case of loss of any personal item or any such property either in the coach, car, hotel, any sightseeing place, flight, taxi, cable car, cruise, ferry, train, tram or restaurants under any circumstances.</span></li>
<li><span>No seats are reserved except the first two seats for the tour manager. We find it fair to enforce daily seats rotation. Please adhere to the instructions given by the tour manager in this regard.</span></li>
<li><span>As per the law in many countries, it is mandatory to wear a seat belt in the coach. If the client is not wearing the same, he/she may have to pay a fine to the police / local authorities.

<li><span>The Client/Customer travelling by Air would be subject to the Airline restrictions or limitations on baggage weight/ size / number. As porterage is not included in the tour price and due to limited space for luggage in the coach, it is recommended that the Client should carry one single suitcase per person, preferably with wheels for sake of convenience. Airline may charge extra for bags more than specific weight. Such additional charges will be borne directly by client / customer. </span></li>
<li><span>All baggage and personal effects are at all times and in all circumstances the responsibility of the Client/Customer. Mango Holidays (India) Pvt.
